the structure of the git hub is not that well structured, you cant tell which is imprtant to learn first, so i added this page initially to know how to start.
- first start with the introduction to ml
- get hands on what are optimizers and start to understand the gradient descent first, to know how the loss is optimized.
- go with linear regression, basic regression model to know how actually all thsese are done.
- logistic regression, a classification model to also know how these models work.
