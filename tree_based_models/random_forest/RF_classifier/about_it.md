# What is it
- as the name suggests, we are using the random forest for classification problem.

### NOTE: images rearding this page will be in the **images/RFC_images** path.

## Process of creating a random forest
- Lets take a dataset for example as shown in the **image1.png.**
- the first step is to create new datasets from the original dataset. for example lets create only 4, in real world we build more that 100s of datasets.
- we are going to select the rows randomly for each new dataset from the original dataset, and every new dataset will be the same size as the original dataset.
